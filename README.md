# wordlist
[Wordlist](http://oylenshpeegul.github.io/Compress-DAWG/) compression in Go.

This is a compression scheme for sorted lists of words. I did it years ago [in Perl](https://github.com/oylenshpeegul/Compress-DAWG) and again [in Python](https://github.com/oylenshpeegul/Compress-DAWG/blob/master/wordlist.py). I have since learned it is called [front compression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_encoding). Another version appears in [word-list-compress](http://www.man-online.org/page/1-word-list-compress/) used by [aspell](http://aspell.net/).
